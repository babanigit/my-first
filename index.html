        <h1>MY ANIME WEBSITE</h1>
        <p>
          anime, style of animation popular in Japanese films. Early anime films
          were intended primarily for the Japanese market and, as such, employed
          many cultural references unique to Japan. For example, the large eyes
          of anime characters are commonly perceived in Japan as multifaceted
          “windows to the soul.” Much of the genre is aimed at children, but
          anime films are sometimes marked by adult themes and subject matter.
          Modern anime began in 1956 and found lasting success in 1961 with the
          establishment of Mushi Productions by Osamu Tezuka, a leading figure
          in modern manga, the dense, novelistic Japanese comic book style that
          contributed greatly to the aesthetic of anime. Anime such as Miyazaki
          Hayao’s Princess Mononoke (1997) are the modern equivalent of the epic
          folk adventures once filmed by Japanese masters such as Mizoguchi
          Kenji and Kurosawa Akira. At the turn of the 21st century, anime began
          to attain wide international popularity with the Pokémon television
          series and films such as Miyazaki’s Spirited Away (2002), winner of an
          Academy Award for best animated feature film.

          <h1>ATTACK ON TITAN</h1>
          <p>
            Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin,
            lit. "The Advancing Giants") is a Japanese manga series written and
            illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity
            lives inside cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect
            them from the gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans;
            the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans
            after a Titan brings about the destruction of his hometown and the
            death of his mother. Attack on Titan was serialized in Kodansha's
            monthly shōnen manga magazine Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from
            September 2009 to April 2021, with its chapters collected in 34
            tankōbon volumes. An anime television series was produced by Wit
            Studio (seasons 1–3) and MAPPA (season 4). A 25-episode first season
            was broadcast from April to September 2013, followed by a 12-episode
            second season broadcast from April to June 2017. A 22-episode third
            season was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes airing
            from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes airing from April
            to July 2019. A fourth and final season premiered in December 2020,
            airing 16 episodes in its first part, with the remainder announced
            to begin airing in January 2022. Attack on Titan has become a
            critical and commercial success. As of December 2019, the manga has
            over 100 million tankōbon copies in print worldwide, making it one
            of the best-selling manga series of all time. It has won several
            awards, including the Kodansha Manga Award, the Attilio Micheluzzi
            Award, and the Harvey Award.

          <h1>STEINs GATES</h1>

          <p>
            Steins;Gate is a 2011 anime television series created by the
            animation studio White Fox based on 5pb. and Nitroplus's 2009 visual
            novel of the same name, and is part of the Science Adventure
            franchise along with Chaos;Head and Robotics;Notes. It is set in
            2010 and follows Rintaro Okabe, who together with his friends
            accidentally discovers a method of time travel through which they
            can send text messages to the past, thereby changing the present.
            The series was directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Satō, and
            written by Jukki Hanada, with animation direction and character
            design by Kyuuta Sakai, and music by Takeshi Abo. It aired for 24
            episodes and was simulcast in North and South America, Africa, the
            Middle East, and parts of Europe by Crunchyroll and the United
            Kingdom by Anime on Demand. A 25th episode was later included with
            the DVD and Blu-ray releases; these releases were handled by
            Funimation in North America and by Manga Entertainment in the United
            Kingdom. Steins;Gate was well-received by critics, who praised the
            characters, story and writing, however some criticism went towards
            pacing of the first half; it is considered one of the best anime
            series of the 2010s.[4][5][6] The series has spawned four original
            net animation episodes and a spinoff film. An anime adaptation of
            Steins;Gate 0, the sequel to the original Steins;Gate game,
            premiered in 2018.

          <h1>NARUTO</h1>

          <p>
            Naruto (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series written
            and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto
            Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and
            dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story
            is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and
            the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga
            by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable
            mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and
            Naruto (1997). Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly
            Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form
            in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series
            produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in
            Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on
            Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a
            sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended
            in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub was broadcast on Disney
            XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then
            switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January
            2014, starting over from the first episode. The English dub is still
            airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began streaming
            the anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December
            2012 on 99 episodes, and ended on March 2016, after 338 episodes.
            Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and
            twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related
            merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards
            developed by several companies. Viz Media licensed the manga and
            anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their
            digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing
            in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom
            and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most
            OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film
            premiering in movie theaters. The story of Naruto continues with
            Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations:
            Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his
            father's. Naruto is the fourth best-selling manga series in history
            having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries
            and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97
            million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's
            best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes
            have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list
            several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006.
            Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong
            storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the
            fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga,
            which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references
            from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

            Shonen manga and anime have always been aimed towards young
            demographics, particularly young male teens, which is why most
            series contain PG-level violence, but it also explains why most of
            the protagonists are teenage boys. The desire Eren possesses to
            avenge his mother’s death and wipe the Titans’ existence from the
            earth is the strongest and the maximum of how much Shonen
            characteristics Attack on Titan contains. The anime contains a lot
            of violence and gory themes, there are enough instances where the
            terror of war, torture, genocide, bloodbath, mass destruction and
            other dark themes are touched upon and this is what makes AOT
            appropriate for adult viewership, especially when they learn more
            about that dark time in human history. Attack on Titan revolves
            around the brutal realities of war, rife with themes of death, loss,
            duty, and perseverance. The show’s first season establishes the
            dystopian world and the core mysteries surrounding the origin of the
            Titans. ATTACK ON TITAN amazingly portrays human emotions, one of
            the reasons it’s so addictive. The plot becomes so deep at certain
            points, it’s too difficult to process.
